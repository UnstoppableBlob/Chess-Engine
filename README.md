# Chess Engine.py

## Update

In the update, I added smooth piece movements, fixed multiple small bugs, and added a checkmate message.

## Description

In this game, you choose a difficulty level for stockfish and then play chess against it.

## How to Play

First, after launching the app, you click on the text box and enter a level from 1 to 20, 20 being the hardest. You then play chess like you would on any other online chess app.
